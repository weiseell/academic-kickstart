Ellen Weise is a 2nd year MS student at Michigan State University in the Fisheries and Wildlife department. Her work at the Robinson and Scribner labs has focused on developing genomic and computational tools to assess populations within an adaptive management framework. Her thesis work focuses on the use of effective population size estimates and pedigree reconstruction to assess sea lamprey spawning populations. She has a secondary interest in outreach, where she has focused on leveraging informal outreach techniques to pique STEM interest for K12 students and using a storytelling framework to introduce contemporary science concepts to adult audiences.
