Most of my outreach work has focused on K12 students, where I specialized in the use of informal teaching techniques to spark interest in STEM learning through visual demonstrations paired with explanation. I have recently been working on applications of STEAM outreach techniques to develop materials for adults without a science background. 

My outreach approach with K12 students involves non-traditional, informal presentations as school wide assemblies, classroom activities, and table demonstrations. Large presentations generally involve large, visual demonstrations paired with short explanations to engage students with a concept first then explain it in more detail. In the classroom, students work through a small group of connected activities to introduce a few key concepts, followed by discussion and questions. All of these different tactics are used primarily to pique interest and prompt discussion of science concepts with the goal of sparking interest in STEM for students.

When it comes to outreach for adults, the goal is to ground contemporary science concepts in the human elements present in science, which allows for incorporation of scientific topics in a storytelling framework. By using this STEAM approach, we hope to reach audiences that donâ€™t have an explicit interest in learning about science, but are curious about people and how they look at the world, and use that to frame science concepts within that story.
