Overall, my recent projects have involved the development of genomic and computational tools to assess populations within an adaptive management framework. In order to have an effective adaptive management framework, accurate assessment is needed to quantify the effects of management actions on the population. Genetic assessment provides an in-depth look at a population from effective population size to inbreeding and genetic diversity that can be used to infer the overall health of a population and how that population changes on a generational basis.

My MS research focuses on developing population assessment tools for sea lamprey using genomic methods like effective number of breeders and minimum number of breeders. We use these population abundance metrics to make inferences about the success of alternative control techniques and evaluate larval cohort identification techniques. We also plan to look at the relationship between these estimates and environmental influences as well as sample size. 

Using genetic data from a translocation event in Hunt Creek, we built an assessment framework for genetic rescue. We developed a simulation-based pre-assessment technique to predict the effect different management actions would have on genetic diversity in a small population. We then used genetic data to evaluate the empirical success of the translocation at increasing genetic diversity in the offspring spawned after the translocation by calculating genetic diversity metrics and looking for assortative mating among source populations.

An emerging technique for evaluating full aquatic communities is eDNA metabarcoding, which involves the collection of environmental samples and sequencing the DNA with a universal barcode to sequence any DNA that was shed in the community. We used this technique as an early-detection tool for AIS detection as well as determining total species diversity in an aquatic community.
